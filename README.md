## üöÄ Project overview
This repository contains an improved YOLOv8 implementation optimized for UAV-based insulator defect detection.
Key improvements:
- MobileNetV3 as lightweight backbone for lower FLOPs and faster inference.
- Added attention modules (CBAM) to enhance feature representation.
- Replaced the original loss function with **WiouV3** to enhance bounding box regression and overall detection precision.
- Preserved feature fusion capability to maintain detection performance for both large and small targets.
- Dataset: 3000+ UAV-captured insulator images with complex backgrounds.
